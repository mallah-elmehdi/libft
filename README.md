# libft

### Description

This project the very first project as a student at 42. The project require to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that they will be used during the whole cursus.

The **libft** projet is divided into 2 parts:

**part I**
Recode a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man, they present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals, and these functions are as follows:

- memset
- bzero
- memcpy
- memccpy
- memmove
- memchr
- memcmp
- strlen
- strlcpy
- strlcat
- strchr
- strrchr
- strnstr
- strncmp
- atoi
- isalpha
- isdigit
- isalnum
- isascii
- isprint
- toupper
- tolower
- calloc
- strdup

**part II**
Set of functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different form. Some of these functions can be useful to write Part 1â€™s functions, and these functions are as follows:

- ft_substr
- ft_strjoin
- ft_strtrim
- ft_split
- ft_itoa
- ft_strmapi
- ft_putchar_fd
- ft_putstr_fd
- ft_putendl_fd
- ft_putnbr_fd
